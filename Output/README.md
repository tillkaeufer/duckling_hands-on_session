### Output folder

In this folder all the retrieval output is saved.  
Every subfolder is the subfolder you specified in the input file.
Typically, one folder corresponds to one observation/object.  
If you are running multiple fit for the same object, you can change the run_numer in the input file.
This will create new files in your subfolder with the specified number leading all file names.  
Within each subfolder you find a figure folder in which all the figures are saved.
